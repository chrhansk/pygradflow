# PyGradFlow

PyGradFlow is a simple implementation of the sequential homotopy method to
be used to solve general nonlinear programs.

To solve a nonlinear problem, subclass the `Problem` class, implementing
its abstract methods, pass a problem instance to a `Solver`, and call
its `solve()` method.

Note: This code is for research purposes, not productive use.
